Designed a game language for the Tetris game with configurable elements using Yacc, Bison and C++.
The syntax and grammar were written from scratch. We have a few sample scripts and tests (the .t files) which can be run to observe the functioning. 
For the full design and more details, please refer to the Full Submission PDF. There is a handy flowchart there, which will explain the flow of the design.
